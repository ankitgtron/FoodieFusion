   - **Why:** Node.js is lightweight, efficient, and ideal for asynchronous operations.
   - **Use Case:** Handles server logic for user authentication, orders, and payments.

2. **Express.js**
   - **Why:** A minimal web framework that simplifies routing and middleware handling.
   - **Use Case:** Manages routes such as login, signup, menu, and cart.

---

### **Database:**
1. **MongoDB**
   - **Why:** MongoDB offers flexible schema design, making it ideal for dynamic app requirements.
   - **Use Case:** Storing data for users, menu items, and orders.
